__Live Tool Website__: https://maretana.github.io/earthlock-bestiary/

# Motivation
This tool was created on my spare time to have the ___Earthlock: Festival of Fire___ bestiary always available while playing, specifically during a battle.

The idea was to use it on my phone but this site is fully responsive and can be used in any number of devices. This is meant to replicate the interface of the game and only provide the information the actual bestiary gives you. For more details and locations of the enemies, you can search for other guides online.

# Tech stack
These are the technlogies I'm using for this tool. This project was a good practice with them.
* __React JS__: I'm using react to tacke advantage of the reusable components and ease of handling JS events. 
* __Create React App__: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* __Sass__: All styling done with Sass. Mainly because of shared variables and scoping.
* __Eric Meyer's Reset 2.0__: Good ol' CSS reset found [here](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).
* __Standard JS__: My favorite code style in javascript land.
* __gh-pages__: For publishing on GitHub Pages.

# Accessibility
You can navigate through the bestiary using TAB navigation on a desktop browser.
